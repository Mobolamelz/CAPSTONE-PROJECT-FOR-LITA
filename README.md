### PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project conducts an in-depth analysis of sales Performance for a Retail Store encompassing various Regions, product types, quantity sold, Order ID, Customer ID, Order date, and unit prices. The primary objective is to derive actionable insights on retrieving each product category's total sales, find the number of sales transactions in each region, find the highest-selling product by total sales value, calculate total revenue per product, calculate monthly sales totals for the current year, find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount, calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region, identify products with no sales in the last quarter. The goal is to produce an interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights these findings.

### OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT
This project aims to address the following analyses:

Total Sales Revenue: Calculate the total sales revenue by multiplying the quantity by price per unit to understand the overall sales performance.
Sales Trends Over Time: Use the date columns to analyze sales trends over different months, to identify peak and periods of low sales.
Region Performance Comparison: Compare sales across different regions to determine which locations are performing better. This can help identify top-performing branches and those that may need additional support.
Product Performance: Determine which products generate the most revenue or are sold most frequently using the product column. This can help in managing inventory and marketing efforts.
Top-Selling Products: Identify which products are sold most frequently (unit sold) to maintain adequate stock levels of materials.
Slow-Moving Inventory: Spot products with low sales that may require special promotions.
Branch-Level Stock Analysis: Understand which branches sell particular products faster and require frequent restocking of material.

### KEY METRICS
Total Revenue: This represents the overall income generated from sales, calculated as the sum of the revenue column.
Total Units Sold: This denotes the cumulative number of units sold, obtained by summing the units sold column.
Sales Growth Rate: This measures the percentage increase in sales revenue over a specific period (e.g., month-over-month, year-over-year).
Sales Performance Over Time: This involves analyzing trends over different time frames (daily, weekly, monthly) to identify peak sales periods.
